    "In the late 1860s, Adolf Fick, a professor of physiology in the Faculty of Medicine in W ̈urzberg, Germany, developed one of the methods we use today for measuring how much blood your heart pumps in a minute. Your cardiac output as you read this sentence is probably about 7 L/min. At rest it is likely to be a bit under 6 L/min. If you are a trained marathon runner running a marathon, your cardiac output can be as high as 30 L/min. Your cardiac output can be calculated with the formula\n",
