# Docker
- docker image: layered file that executes Docker container
  - essentially a "snapshot" of a virtual environment; a record of a virtual machine
  - immutable
  includes sys libs, tools, files/ dependencies
- docker container: "printout of a docker image"
- docker hub: a cloud based registry service for image repos
- includes all dependencies needed for the code it wraps (resource isolation)
- can run multiple "containers" on same OS


# Kernel
- centre of an OS, provides basic functions

# Design Patterns
- Composition over Inheritence
  - take state as function parameters.
  - "Has a" vs "Is a", but favor composition

# Java
- static typing
- structure through braces and semicolons
- No dictionary! Map
- char -> int: Character.getNumericValue()
- for loop: for(var i; i<ending_condintion,increment){};
- no nested functions
- Change string to char array: .toCharArray();
- indexing strings: .charAt(i);
