# Kitchen Sink
- list index == num smaller than
- sort one list by another
  - lambda sort, or dict lookup
- dicts: setdefault
- List
  - split each char List(s)
  - split by seperator s.split(<sep>)
  - when indexing, always check for empty first
- custom comparator: neg = left first
- how to convert comp to key?
- join is a _string_ method!
- tree? recurse
- always forget: _duplicatessss_
- always check none
- trees: careful w comp parent or child
- backtrackinggggg
- level order traversal: pre traversal
- should get better w tree serial/ deserial

#! to review
!! i still don't get the increasing substring q
? is setting a whole row faster than setting each element?
!? why doesn't the factor approach work for sqrt
? how to know when to use binary search (sqrt q)
  - searching in one dimension
! learn graphs and search/ traversal better
!! I think i need to do an algorithms course :P

!! with recusive/ search problems (often searches are recursive problems)
- find a dimension you can break down along
  - ex: longest subarray: subarrays of len x
  - watch .006 on DP
!! Greedy: see if its possible. strictly increasing/ monotonous things normally make it possible
!! get familiar w bfs vs dfs in perms and other scenarios
?? How can I tell when the entire search space needs to be searched? no heuristic? (ex: coin change)

Brush up
- nested loops
- serial/ deserial
- binary
